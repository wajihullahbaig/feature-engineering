# feature-engineering
Feature engineering is an integral part of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms work on numbers, and we as humans have to specify what these
numbers should look like for an algorithm to be able to use it in a meaningful way, such that the outcome from feature engineering is to help a machine 
learning algorithm do a better job.
